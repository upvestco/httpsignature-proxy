# httpsignature-proxy

tl;dr: Localhost HTTP Signatures proxy.

The Upvest API requires you to use [HTTP Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-01.html) for extra layer of security to verify the call is coming from a real tenant as well as ensure the request hasn't been tampered with on the way.

This is good for security but can be cumbersome while developing. That's why this tool exists. You run it locally on your dev machine and use the localhost port in your Postman, Insomnia, etc. tool to make your calls to the Upvest Sandbox.

$ ./httpsignature-proxy
